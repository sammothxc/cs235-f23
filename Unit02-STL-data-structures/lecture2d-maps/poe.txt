In shadowed realms where dark thoughts bloom,
I wandered through a midnight's gloom,
A tortured soul, lost and forlorn,
In search of solace, I was torn.

The raven perched on yonder tree,
Its eyes aflame with mystery,
It spoke of tales from ancient lore,
Of love and loss forevermore.

Upon a sea of blackest night,
I sailed through dreams of pale moonlight,
Where specters danced with ghostly grace,
In death's embrace, I found my place.

The walls of melancholy creaked,
In chambers where my secrets leaked,
Whispers of the forgotten past,
A haunting echo, everlast.

Beneath the floorboards, heartbeats pound,
A maddened sound, a dreadful mound,
Concealed, the guilt of sins untold,
A nightmare's grip, an iron hold.

Through crypts and catacombs I tread,
Among the shadows of the dead,
The darkness whispered secrets grim,
As I walked this haunted realm within.

In realms where darkness reigns supreme,
I sought a glimpse of shattered dreams,
In the raven's eye, I found my fate,
A poet cursed, I'll contemplate.

In this world of sorrow and woe,
The legacy of Poe shall grow,
With tales of darkness, fear, and dread,
Forever haunting hearts and head.
